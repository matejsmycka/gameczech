      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/&#34;&gt;html/template&lt;/a&gt; library for&#xA;its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very&#xA;small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of&#xA;logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other&#xA;template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of&#xA;similarities in Go templates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
